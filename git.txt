Installing Git on a Local Machine:
Download the latest version of Git for your operating system from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads).
For Windows:
Double-click on the downloaded executable file to launch the installer.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Once installed, open the Git Bash application from the Start menu.
For macOS:
Open the Terminal application, which can be found in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder.
Check if Git is already installed by typing git --version in the Terminal window.
If Git is not installed, you can install it using the Homebrew package manager. First, install Homebrew by typing /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" in the Terminal.
After installing Homebrew, install Git by typing brew install git in the Terminal.
For Linux:
The installation process varies depending on the Linux distribution you are using. You can typically install Git using the package manager (e.g., apt-get, yum, dnf, etc.).
For example, if you are using Ubuntu, you can install Git by typing sudo apt-get install git in the Terminal.
After installing Git, you can start using it to collaborate on projects hosted on GitHub.
